 The Random Quote Generator

 Student: Kyle Zvejnieks

A project for the Team Treehouse Full Stack Development path that generates
a random quote on the press of a button. Extra features include conditional
display of possible "tags" properties, quotes changing at an interval, and
the web page background changing color when a new quote is loaded.
